This map visualizes the employee data for the city of san Francisco by sector. The business information comes from the ESRI Business Analyst dataset. This dataset provides information on all businesses, their SIC value and the number of employees they have along with other more specific data. I used that dataset to visualize the number of employees each business has in San Francisco along with which sector they correspond to. This map provides valuable insights of which sectors of the economy employs the most people and what is their spatial distribution around the city of San Francisco.

To generate the map, I selected the business data that intersected with the city of San Francisco. I then joined the SIC ids of the businesses to their official description and merged the business sectors to 9 broad categories for visualization. Each business was then allocated to one sector. The number of employees each business has affects the radius of the circle that is representing it and the color of the circle shows the sector the business corresponds to.
