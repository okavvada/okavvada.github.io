My research interests include systems-level analysis and life-cycle assessment of decentralized water reuse infrastructure. Particularly, I am interested in developing planning support tools to improve our usage of energy and water resources under the constraints of climate change.\r\nMy skills range from spatial modeling, control and optimization to modern data analysis and machine learning. My main research area is on integrated planning and systems level analysis for urban water systems in order to minimize energy and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\n### Non-Potable Water Reuse in San Francisco\r\nTo get an unerstanding of the effect of spatial parameters and scale for water reuse in San Francisco visit the <a href=\"https://okavvada.github.io/San_Francisco_webpage/\">blog post</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving thoughts you wish to share?
